# zero2prod

Working my way through the book [Zero to Production in Rust](https://www.zero2prod.com/) by Luca Palmieri. Hoping to pick up a bit more Rust, learn some new tricks and a bit about the ecosystem.

## Running the server

You can run the web server with:

```
cargo run
```

or start in watch mode with:

```
cargo watch -x check -x run
```

## Other tricks

View the code generated by different macros with:

```
cargo expand
```

View logging for tests:

```
TEST_LOG=true cargo test
```
